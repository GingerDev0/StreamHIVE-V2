## Overview

StreamHIVE V2 is a streaming-app style media database built with PHP, SQLite, TMDB data, Apache routes, AJAX browsing, local profile storage, and a fast local import cache.

The app fetches missing or incomplete movie, TV, episode, season, and actor records from TMDB on demand, stores them locally in SQLite, and then serves detail/listing pages from the local cache for speed.

> This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version / Notes |
|---|---|
| PHP | `8.1` or newer |
| Server | Apache with `mod_rewrite`, or PHP's built-in server for local development |
| Database | SQLite |
| PHP extensions | `curl`, `pdo_sqlite`, `sqlite3` |
| API credentials | TMDB v4 Read Access Token, or TMDB v3 API key |

---

## Installation

1. Clone or upload the repository to your server.
2. Point your web root to `public/`.
3. If you cannot change the web root, keep the included root `.htaccess`; it routes requests into `public/`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
5. Add your TMDB credentials and change the admin token.
6. Make `storage/` writable by PHP.
7. Open the site in your browser.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod -R 775 storage
```

---

## Environment file

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```ini
TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN=your_tmdb_v4_read_access_token_here
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_v3_api_key_here

APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
ADMIN_TOKEN=change-this-token

SQLITE_PATH=

SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE=MEMORY
SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS=NORMAL
SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
```

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN` | Preferred TMDB v4 Read Access Token. Paste the token without the word `Bearer`. |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | Optional TMDB v3 API key fallback. |
| `APP_ENV` | Use `local` for development and `production` for live sites. |
| `APP_DEBUG` | Use `true` locally and `false` in production. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | Query-string token for admin routes. Change this before deployment. |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | Leave blank to use `storage/database.sqlite`, or provide an absolute path. |
| `SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE` | `MEMORY` avoids slow sidecar writes on some shared hosts. |
| `SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS` | `NORMAL` is faster; `FULL` is safer but slower. |
| `SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | SQLite wait time when the database is busy. |

---

## TMDB credentials

1. Create or log in to a TMDB account.
2. Open account settings.
3. Go to the API section.
4. Create or request API access.
5. Copy the v4 API Read Access Token into `TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN`.
6. Optionally copy the v3 API key into `TMDB_API_KEY` as a fallback.

---

## Local development

From the project root:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Main routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home page |
| `/movies` | Movie listing |
| `/movies/movie-name` | Movie detail page |
| `/tv` | TV listing |
| `/tv/tv-show-name` | TV show detail page |
| `/tv/tv-show-name/s01` | Season detail page |
| `/tv/tv-show-name/s01/e01` | Episode detail page |
| `/actors` | Actor listing |
| `/actors/actor-name` | Actor detail page |
| `/actor/actor-name` | Actor detail alias |
| `/coming-this-year` | Upcoming movies and TV shows for the year |
| `/s` | Search page |
| `/s/search-query` | Search by path |
| `/s?q=search-query` | Search by query string |
| `/profile` | Local bookmarks and recently viewed items |

`/coming-this-year` is the exception to the global released-only filter, so upcoming movies and TV shows can still be listed there.

---

## Admin routes

Use your `ADMIN_TOKEN` query-string value:

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/admin?token=change-this-token` | Admin dashboard |
| `/admin/import?token=change-this-token` | Import tools |
| `/admin/manage/movies?token=change-this-token` | Manage movies |
| `/admin/manage/tv?token=change-this-token` | Manage TV shows |
| `/admin/manage/actors?token=change-this-token` | Manage actors |

The admin area includes stats, imports, prefetched full-import actions, filters, sorting, previews, pagination, and delete actions.

For a public production site, replace the query-string token with proper authentication.

---

## SQLite storage

By default, StreamHIVE creates this database:

```text
storage/database.sqlite
```

You can override it in `.env`:

```ini
SQLITE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite
```

SQLite schema and derived search/filter columns are created automatically. Existing rows are backfilled when needed.

| Optimization | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Transactions | Faster batch upserts. |
| Prepared statements | Reused database statements. |
| Indexed slug checks | Collision-safe slugs with quick lookups. |
| SQL pagination | Pages query only the rows needed for the current page. |
| Verified imports | Missing content is fetched, saved, verified as readable, then redirected. |

---

## Content visibility rules

Across public browsing and detail pages, StreamHIVE hides media that should not appear in the main catalogue yet.

| Media type | Hidden when missing date | Hidden when future dated | Exception |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Movies | Yes | Yes | `/coming-this-year` allows upcoming movies |
| TV shows | Yes | Yes | `/coming-this-year` allows upcoming TV shows |
| Seasons | Yes | Yes | None |
| Episodes | Yes | Yes | None |
| Actors | No | No | Actors are not filtered by release dates |

---

## Movie collections

Movie detail pages can show a full-width **Movies In This Collection** section when TMDB returns collection data for the movie.

| Collection feature | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Placement | Appears above the cast/recommended row. |
| Background | Uses the TMDB collection backdrop. |
| Cards | Uses the same movie card format as index/listing pages. |
| Carousel | Uses Splide with normal scrolling and no elastic re-centering. |
| Arrows | Previous and next buttons sit at the far left and far right of the section. |
| Filtering | Future-dated and undated movies are excluded. |

---

## Player embeds

Movies use MultiEmbed with the TMDB ID first:

```text
https://multiembed.mov/?video_id={tmdb_id}&tmdb=1
```

Episodes use:

```text
https://multiembed.mov/?video_id={tv_tmdb_id}&tmdb=1&s={season}&e={episode}
```

If a TMDB ID is unavailable, the app can fall back to IMDb ID URLs.

---

## Auto-import and fetching modal

When a visitor opens a movie, TV show, episode, season, or actor that is missing locally, the app shows a non-dismissible **Fetching content** modal.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | Visitor opens missing or partial content. |
| 2 | StreamHIVE shows the fetching modal. |
| 3 | The record is imported or upgraded from TMDB. |
| 4 | The data is written to SQLite. |
| 5 | StreamHIVE verifies the record is readable. |
| 6 | The visitor is automatically navigated to the completed page. |

Fully imported local records open immediately.

---

## Search and filtering

| Feature | Supported |
|---|---:|
| Search by title/name | Yes |
| Movies, TV, actors, or combined search | Yes |
| Genre filters | Yes |
| Year filters | Yes |
| Age-rating filters | Yes |
| Sort order | Yes |
| Top and bottom pagination | Yes |
| AJAX listing/search updates | Yes |
| Navbar live search capped to 6 local results | Yes |

---

## Profile page

`/profile` is stored in the visitor's browser with `localStorage`.

| Profile area | Details |
|---|---|
| Bookmarks | Saved movies, TV shows, and actors. |
| Recently viewed | One history entry per item. Opening the same item again moves it to the front. |
| Accounts | No account system required. |

---

## Migrating old JSON storage

If you have older JSON folders such as `storage/movies`, `storage/tv`, or `storage/people`, the app can migrate them into SQLite.

```bash
php scripts/migrate-json-to-sqlite.php
```

After confirming the admin dashboard shows the imported records, the JSON files can be removed or kept as a backup.

---

## GitHub packaging notes

This repository should include source files, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.htaccess` files, and `.gitkeep` files for empty storage folders.

Do not commit:

| File / folder | Reason |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Contains private credentials. |
| `storage/database.sqlite` | Runtime database. |
| `database.sqlite` | Runtime database. |
| `*.sqlite-wal` | SQLite sidecar file. |
| `*.sqlite-shm` | SQLite sidecar file. |
| `*.sqlite-journal` | SQLite sidecar file. |
| `storage/cache` | Runtime cache/import files. |
| `storage/movies` | Legacy/runtime imported content. |
| `storage/tv` | Legacy/runtime imported content. |
| `storage/people` | Legacy/runtime imported content. |

---

## Attribution guard

This build includes a transparent runtime attribution guard. The app checks `app/Views/layouts/app.php` on boot and returns a clear `503 Project attribution required` page if the visible footer attribution is removed or changed.

The footer must keep:

```text
Created by GingerDev
TMDB data powers imports. This product is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.
Project link: https://github.com/GingerDev0/StreamHIVE-V2
```

The visible footer attribution is checked strictly. Changing the creator text, TMDB notice, project-link text, project URL, or removing the GitHub footer navigation link will make the app return `503 Project attribution required`.

Restore the exact required footer attribution to make the site load again.
